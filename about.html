        <h1>The Canadian Infrastructure Tracking Project</h1>
    </header>

    <p>With Canada rolling up it's sleeves in an attempt to become more economically self sufficient, infrastructure
        projects are going to pop up very rapidly. We believe it would be most beneficial to set up a dedicated database
        for a number of reasons. Without a proper way to track projects organization and communication will be subpar
        leading to either longer wait times for projects to start or finish completion. Another issue is the potential
        for non efficient spending because there is no current way to tell whether projects are worthwhile and not
        overlapping. This rolls over into another problem, the big picture and desired direction. How will Canada look
        after implementation of current projects? We won't know unless we have the ability to see a bird's eye view or
        in other words an efficient dataset.</p>
