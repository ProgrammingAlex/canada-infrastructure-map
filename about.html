        <p>
            With Canada rolling up it's sleeves in an attempt to become more economically self sufficient,
            infrastructure projects are going to start popping up very rapidly. We believe it would be most beneficial
            to set up a dedicated database for a number of reasons. Without a proper way to track projects organization
            and communication will be subpar leading to either longer wait times for projects to start or finish
            completion. Another issue is the potential for non efficient spending because there is no current way to
            tell whether projects are worthwhile and not overlapping. This rolls over into another problem, the big
            picture and desired direction. How will Canada look after implementation of current projects? We won't know
            unless we have the ability to see a bird's eye view or in words an efficient dataset.
